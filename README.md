# shestem-assignment
Traffic Volume Prediction using supervised machine learning (Linear Regression, Random Forest). Includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation with RMSE/R², and visualization of traffic patterns for real-world insights.  

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/traffic-prediction-dataset

This project predicts traffic volume using supervised ML models:

Linear Regression
Random Forest
The notebook includes:
